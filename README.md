# Interface Generator

Generates TypeScript interfaces from Go structs, so that matching types can be used in both the front and back end.

Repurposes some code from [This Project](https://github.com/StirlingMarketingGroup/go2ts/blob/master/assets/go/main.go)

I'll add more to this README later if anyone else wants to use it, for now it is only used by the shine-structs project in the shine-modules group. -Dan
